       <h2>About Me</h2>
       <p>
        My name is Fares, I am 23 years old, and I am from Algeria. I am currently a 1<sup>st</sup> year student in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design ">IMD</abbr> program at <strong>Algonquin College</strong>. Before coming to Canada, I studied technology science in my home country, which helped me develop an interest in digital media and technology. Through this program, I hope to improve my creative and technical skills to achieve my goals.

       <p> 
        In my free time, I enjoy activities that help me relax and stay motivated, such as playing basketball, going to the gym, playing shooter games, and driving my car through the mountains. I am really into cars and I enjoy learning about mechanical things. I am also very interested in being creative, especially in photography and videography, where I can express ideas and show my skills.
