       <h2>About Me</h2>
       <p>
        My name is Fares, I am 23 years old, and I am from Algeria. I am currently a student in the Interactive Media Design (IMD) program at Algonquin College. Before coming to Canada, I studied technology science in my home country, which helped me develop an interest in digital media and technology. Through this program, I hope to improve my creative and technical skills and gain hands-on experience.
